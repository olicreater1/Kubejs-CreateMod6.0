# Kubejs-CreateMod6.0
This is going to be a compilation of a bunch of kubejs recipes I make as a quality of life improvement to Create6.0 (the mod)

# Organization of files
1. Files containing **server_event** are to be put in the server events Kubejs folder
2. Files containing **startup_event** are startup events for Kubsjs
3. Folders are named after what mods you need for a file
4. Folders may need subfolders to show multiple mods neccicairy **If this gets out of hand I may just have folders for each package with READMEs in each to show what mods you need**
# Kubejs
I don't plan to keep an updated list of Kubejs versions and files to support this repo but I will link the website
**https://kubejs.com/**
